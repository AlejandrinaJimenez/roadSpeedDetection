# roadSpeedDetection
In this repository we build a simple method for measuring speed of moving objects in road, the final purpose is to see the effects on a raspberry pi camera in real time


This software is designed to run on Raspberry Pi, with python and opencv 3.*

The file install.py will set up a rectangle to limit the road and set departure and arrival points for the measurement of speed
